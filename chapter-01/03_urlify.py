1.3
URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may
assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional
characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If
implementing in Java, please use the character array so that you can perform
this operation in place.)

Hints:

#53: It's often easiese to modify strings by going from the end of the string
to the beginning.

#118: You might find you need to know the number of spaces. Can you just count
them?
