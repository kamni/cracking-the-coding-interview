1.2
Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a
permutation of the other.

Hints:

#84: There is one solution that is O(N log N) time. Another solution uses some
space, but is O(N) time.

#122: Could a hash table be useful?

#131: Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but
in different orders. Can you make the orders the same?
